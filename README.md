# LLM Manual Q&A Assistant

A local question-answering assistant powered by [LLaMA 3.2 via Ollama] and [LangChain]. This tool allows users to query a manual using natural language, and the model will respond using the manual's content, including citations for the page and chapter where the information was found.

## 📘 Project Purpose

This project was developed to analyze and answer questions based on customer survey documentation. Since responses were given in free-text format, a language model approach was necessary to interpret and summarize user feedback effectively.
